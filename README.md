# Spotify-Themed Web Project

## Overview
This project is a frontend-only web design inspired by Spotify. It includes HTML and CSS files for a login, signup, and main page, styled for an interactive user experience.

## File Structure
```
spotify2/
├── index.html      # Main landing page
├── login.html      # Login page
├── signup.html     # Signup page
├── style.css       # Main styles
├── auth.css        # Authentication page styles
```

## Features
- **Landing Page** (`index.html`): The primary interface for users.
- **Login Page** (`login.html`): A simple user authentication screen.
- **Signup Page** (`signup.html`): Allows new users to register.
- **Custom Styling** (`style.css`, `auth.css`): Clean and modern UI based on Spotify’s design.

## Usage
1. Extract the contents of the ZIP file.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to preview the main page.
3. Navigate to `login.html` or `signup.html` to see the authentication screens.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the webpages.
- **CSS** for styling the layout and responsiveness.

## Future Improvements
- Add JavaScript for interactive elements.
- Improve responsiveness for mobile screens.
- Integrate backend authentication (e.g., Node.js, Firebase, or PHP).
